## Project Goals

The project is designed to attract customers, provide them with a convenient platform to explore the restaurant's menu and services, enable online reservations, and offer a visual delight in the dishes presented.

## Idea
The name of the restaurant "Bella Ciao" comes from the Italian song "Bella ciao". This song is special to Italians and inspired me to name the restaurant. Just as the song carries the story and feelings, I want the restaurant to convey the same atmosphere and give the guests a real Italian atmosphere.

## Design

The design of the project is aimed at conveying the atmosphere of Italian culture and taste, providing an easy and convenient experience for everyone. Here are some key features of the design:



**Colors**: I use the colors of the Italian flag: green, white, and red. This makes the website vibrant and warm.

## Features

The website consists of four pages that are easily accessible from the navigation menu: home page, menu, reservations, gallery. In addition, there is a table reservation button on the home page and on the menu page, which, when clicked, redirects to the order form on the revervations page.
The website has a responsive layout that automatically adjusts when the screen size changes.

**Logo**: Logo also incorporates these colors and conveys the restaurant's identity.

**Text**: Fonts are chosen to make the text clear and beautiful.

**Layout**: Pages are divided into sections to easily find the necessary information.

**Images**: I use high-quality photos of dishes and the restaurant interior.

**Table reservation button**:  When you click the reservation button, it turns green and takes you to the "Reservations" page. This button is a simple and fun way for you to book a table at restaurant.

### Languages Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Accessibility

- During the coding process, I've focused on making the website as user-friendly for accessibility as possible. To achieve this objective.

- I've used semantic HTML elements such as header, section, nav, and footer, providing a clear and meaningful structure to the website, which enhances its accessibility.

- I've added descriptive Alt attributes to images and links. This allows screen readers to explain the content's purpose and context to users with visual impairments.

- I've integrated a hover effect on all buttons to ensure users can easily identify when they're interacting with a button, thus improving the overall user experience.


## Testing

**Manual testing**:
- Link checking:
I alternately clicked on all the internal and external links on the site to make sure they opened and led to the correct pages. All links are working correctly.

- Navigation testing:
I tested how easily users can navigate between different sections and pages of the site using the menu navigation links. I made sure that returning to the main page is available from any page and is intuitive.

- Order Button Check:
I have verified that the table reservation button works correctly and takes me to the reservations page. I also checked that this button changes color and is visually different after being clicked.

- Table booking form testing:
I entered test data into the table reservation form and submitted the form to check that it works correctly. The form is working correctly. I checked the validity of the entered data. Everything works correctly

**Validator HTML**:

**Fixed bugs**

- Bug 1: Broken Link

Issue: social link "Insatgram" on the footer  were leading to incorrect page. <br>
Fix: I reviewed and corrected the URL  of the  link, ensuring they point to the intended page

 - Bug 2: Uneven distribution of elements in the section.

Issue:  the elements within the "Contact Us" section were not centered properly, even though I used tools to display items centered.
 <br>
Fix:  I set equal height and width for all elements within the "Contact Us" section. This helped align the elements at the center of the section, creating a more balanced visual effect.
