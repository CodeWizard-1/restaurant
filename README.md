## Project Goals

The project is designed to attract customers, provide them with a convenient platform to explore the restaurant's menu and services, enable online reservations, and offer a visual delight in the dishes presented.
The name of the restaurant "Bella Ciao" came from the Italian song "Bella ciao." This song is special for Italians, and it inspired our name. Just like the song carries history and feelings, I want the restaurant to convey the same atmosphere and provide our guests with an authentic Italian experience.

## Design

The design of the project is aimed at conveying the atmosphere of Italian culture and taste, providing an easy and convenient experience for everyone. Here are some key features of the design:



**Colors**: We use the colors of the Italian flag: red, white, and green. This makes the website vibrant and warm.

**Logo**: Our logo also incorporates these colors and conveys the restaurant's identity.
